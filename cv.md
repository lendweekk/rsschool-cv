###WORK EXPERIENCE
>Ukrainian Railways
I was involved in the maintenance and development of
electrical equipment, electric transport, program-controlled
machines, automatic lines, and the like. This is a purely
technical profession, which implies an analytical mindset and
is predictably in the "man-technique" category.
At work I got skills to work with machines and mechanisms,
the ability to analytical thinking, spatial imagination,
knowledge and understanding of the basics of electrical
engineering, algorithms of computer technology.
